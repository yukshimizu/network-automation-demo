# network-automation-demo
This repo aims to demonstrate network automation by utilizing [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) and [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/). This includes basic containerlab topologies and related ansible playbooks. Its base network cofigurations and related ansible playbooks actually come from [Network-Automation-Cookbook](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Automation-Cookbook). They are adjusted to Containerlab environments and are updated for aligning with the latest related ansible collections.

## Cisco IOS-based network
Demo environment of Cisco IOS-based network automation is based on [cisco-clab](./cisco-clab/README.md). Once spun up the containerlab, you can demonstrate and play with it by [cisco-ansible-lab](./cisco-ansible-lab/README.md) playbooks.

## Arista EOS-based network
Demo environment of Arista EOS-based network automation is based on [arista-clab](./arista-clab/README.md). Once spun up the containerlab, you can demonstrate and play with it by [arista-ansible-lab](./arista-ansible-lab/README.md) playbooks.
